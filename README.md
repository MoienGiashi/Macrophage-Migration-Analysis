# Macrophage-Migration-Analysis
There are 3 matlab files associated with the project related to Macrophage tracking in different force fileds.
The Deformation file takes PIV data from Image J and plots the PIV vector. It initially asks you the x and y of the center of force. Here we have use Myofibroblast cells to pull collagen, that we denote as MFx and MFy.

The Directedness file based on euclidian and actual path of the migration towards the center of force as well as the overal angle, tells you if the movement of macrophages is directed or not.

The Migration analysis is step by step or overal velocity and angle of movement of macrophages. Depending on steps (time) and original data the code can be changed.
